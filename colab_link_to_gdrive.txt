    # does not work anymore, can't find /content/insurance_circle.py
!pwd   # confirming we are still on content: we are.
!ls -l # confirming insurance_circle.py is on /content
       # it is according to 'ls -l'
       # but it is not if you look at the directory structure on the left panel
!python /content/insurance_circle.py
       # won't work either, same error as !python insurance_circle.py
       # can't find the script
!python content/insurance_circle.py # does not work, same error as expected
!python /insurance_circle.py        # does not work either
