<h2>Notebooks and AI/ML Certifications</h2>
<p>
Includes material (code + description) that I turned into notebooks, in connection to our AI and machine learning certifications (see details <a href="https://mltechniques.com/machine-learning-professional-certifications/">here</a>). You are free to download and run them in your environment.

In particular:

<ul>
<li><code>Interpolation_temperatures_india.ipynb</code> (geospatial statistics) is a simplified solution, part of project 3.2 in the project textbook.</li>  
<li><code>GAN_diabetes.ipynb</code> (generative adversarial network, diabetes dataset) is part of project 5.2 in the project textbook.</li>  
<li><code>sd_vendors</code> (GAN vendor comparison, evaluation metric, holdout method) is part of project 5.1 in the project textbook.</li>  
<li><code>NoGAN.py</code> (very fast better than GAN synthesizer for tabular data, without neural networks) is part of project 2.1 in the project textbook.</li> 
<li><code>Copula_insurance_byGroup.ipynb</code> and <code>Copula_insurance_nogroup.ipynb</code> (insurance dataset, tabular data generation with copulas) are related to project 5.2.  </li>
<li><code>DeepResampling.ipynb</code> is a different version of NoGAN. The full name of the method is Hierarchical Deep Resampling (no neural network involved) or NoGAN2. Also very fast and better than GAN, with self-tuning, and explainable AI.</li>
</ul>

The project textbook is offered to participants in the certification programs. For details about the cost (starting at $44) and how to enroll, see <a href="https://mltechniques.com/machine-learning-professional-certifications/">here</a>.
